# Dynamic Form with React

This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic form in React using the useState hook. The form allows users to add or remove input fields for entering multiple hobbies. 

## Features

- Add multiple hobby input fields dynamically
- Remove input fields (except for the first one)
- Submit the form and log the array of hobbies to the console

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:


2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Observations and Learnings

- Learned how to use the useState hook in React to manage dynamic forms.
- Explored dynamically adding and removing form inputs based on user interactions.
- Practiced handling form submission and updating state accordingly.
- Discovered the importance of maintaining a clear and user-friendly interface while implementing dynamic forms.

## Challenges Faced

- Ensuring that at least one input field is always present while allowing dynamic addition and removal of others required careful handling of state updates.
- Managing the state of an array of objects introduced complexities in updating specific elements without mutating the original state.
